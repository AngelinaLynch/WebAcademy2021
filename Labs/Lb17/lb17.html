		<h5> Looking into the life of career </h5>
		<h6> By Angelina Lynch</h6>
       <p> On naviance I had to do a survey to give me an idea of what type of career I sould be looking into. The website gave me Enterprising. This means id "enjoy" a job or should look into jobs that have to deal with selling things and that I like to pursude people. I dont 100% disagree with this its just I dont know what job id want that would make me happy money wise and career wise. I want a job that doesnt drain me and that I enjoy but that I also make really good money from(100k+ salary job) </p> 
       <p> when it comes to colleges I absolutely have NO clue at 
 all. Ive never looked into colleges because im not even sure what I wanna do or be in the future. I think id want to probably spend 4 years MAX at a college, If im being honest I wouldnt even want to do that but some career that I might want to presue might need 4 years of college. I dont wanna go to a college were I do math and regular school classes I would wanna go to a college specifically for what I pick to do. I feel like since college is so much money why am I gonna be paying for something that doesnt benifit my career so even though I dont know what college I know I dont want 
 to be doing other courses I dont need.</p>
       <p> Some intrests I have that I will look forward to looking into is buisness or maybe a type of lawyer. Its confusing because I also want to be my own boss or open a place of my own. Another thing I know I want for sure is a good salary, i would want 100k at least because I wanna live my life well off where I can manage my house and bills without struggling or being tight with money. I was interested in tattooing awhile ago but i dont know if that can become something in the future. I just wanna do a job that I can be happy in and not regret years of school or being in debt for something im not happy in. I dont wanna waste my time with that type of stuff so I wanna really be sure 100% on what i need to do before spending all the money and effort to just back out later on.</p>
