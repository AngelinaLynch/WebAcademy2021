  <h3 style="color:aqua"> White chicks is a comedy about 2 fbi agents who failed their drug bust. This results in a them taking a case to escort 2 girls known as the wilson sisters instead of an intense mission. They get into a car accident and both girls refuse to go since they have scratches on their face. The boys (marcus and kevin) go undercover as them to avoid getting in trouble.They then live the life as the wilson sisters and try to fit in meeting her friends and the guys who want her.The girls end up finding they were cloned and they go to the fashion show. The movie is funny and the mission takes place towards the end of the movie when the Vandergelds father try to kidnap the girls. This is one of my favorite movies because ive watched this since I was small with my parents and sister. I always found it interesting and funny and got the other jokes when i got older </h3>

  <h3 style="color:aqua"> The color scheme I had here was blue since in the movie there eyes were just very blue and it reminded me of the color I picked for the text. Another thing is the little money navigation bar because everyone the "wilson sisters" hung out with had money and they were at clubs and nice fancy places so they had money.Lastley the background was because they are fbi agents and its like this was a case opened.
