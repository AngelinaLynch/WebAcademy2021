  <h3 style="color:red"> The movie Bride of chucky is one of Don Mancinis chucky films. This movie is about a women named Tiffany valetine bringing chucky back to life. When she succeeds he ends up letting her know news she wasnt expecting resulting in them fighting. Chucky wasnt a fan of this behavior and kills Tiff putting her soul into a doll.They later find out they need to go into different bodies so there put out for a mission to dig Charles Lee Rays grave which is chuckys original form they do this for the heart of damballa which is the pendant that allows them to switch souls with different bodies. During this movie they do ANYTHING they need to fulfill this mission including killing framing and fighting people and each other. This movie is one of my favorites because its so interesting I dont have the need to skip it and thats surprising since I get bored fast. This is a movie i always end up going back to and watching because its funny interesting and sinister at the same time. <h3>

    <h3 style="color:red"> I chose the color scheme red,I did it this way because the movie has lots of blood filled scenes and I thought I should add something most related to him which his knife for the background. Even the little home page icon is a little knife to fit in with the movie and the characters
