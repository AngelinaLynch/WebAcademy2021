<h2> What are my views on spirituality?</h2>

  <div class="dog">
<p><span class=highlight> I personally like the perspective of spirtiuality. I like how it doesnt say anything about a god and its not about religion but it still focuses on belief.</span> <span class=highlight>I find myself always looking for an answer and I feel like its connected to spirituality because it focuses on how theres something more than human spirit but also something that doesnt judge you.
  Spirituality is a journy to find youself and to learn more about the excisitance. I value this because I feel like people care more about what people say about them and change themselves based on the crowed but id rather find myself and meaning with my spirituality as a guide.</span> </p>
