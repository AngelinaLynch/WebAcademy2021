  <h3 style="color:lightpink"> Mean girls is just another teen/school drama. Cady the main character moved from africa to the U.S and its her first time in public school. Cady makes friends with janis  ian and damian. They took her in and warned her about the types of people in the school. The worst being the plastics. Janis ended up having Cady be fake friends with the plastics and try and get dirt on them when reality she was actually becoming one herself. She ended up losing her friendship with janis and damian and stuck with her plastics yet she was continuing to ruin reginas popularity, (giving her food to fatten her up and steal her ex boyfriend) later on she realized how much she changed and won prom queen thinking she didnt deserve it. She ended up reconnecting with janis and everything was okay at the end. This is one of my favorite movies cause its funny and me and my sisters have lots of memories watching it together. Its a movie I can go back to without getting bored and the plot always intrests me even thought I know what will happen next. </h3>

  <h3 style="color:lightpink"> The color scheme I picked was pink because the plastics had rules and one of those was on wednesdays they wear pink. So I made the font pink. The home icon is a little lipstick just to fit in how they all would get dressed up and the background is the burn book that they write in the movie that starts drama.
